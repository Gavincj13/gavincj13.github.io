## About Me 

I am currently a sophmore at James Madison University. I am studying ISAT and plan on concentrating on Environment and Production Systems. Some of my favorite hobbies include working out, fishing, and hunting. I am from Midlothian, VA, which is around 30 minutes outside of Richmond, VA. I am looking forward to this semester, and I am excited to learn more about coding!

### ISAT 252 Final Narrative 

This is the final narrative about my time in ISAT 252 this semester. I really enjoyed this class and am excited to take what I have learned with me onto next semester!

# My Code Portfolio 

Here is a sample of some of the coding projects that I have worked on throughout my ISAT 252 class:

## Hello World Python

This is the first thing that I have coded, it is just a simple Hello World! program.

## MPG to KPL Unit Converion Using Python 

This was the first coding challenge that we did, it is a unit conversion from MPG to KPL. It is a simple, introductory program to get an input/output on the command line. This code was written using Python.

## Python Unit Conversion Library Using TDD

This is a unit conversion library that contains 4 conversions. This was the first time using TDD and implementing that into the process of creating the code. This code was written with Python.

## Rock-Paper-Scissors Game using Python

This is a terminal-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game using python. This game contains 2 versions, one being the traditional version of the game, and the other being the new version Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock taken from the tv show The Big Bang Theory. I learned this code through a walkthrough from the website AskPython.
