# Welcome to Connor's Website!

A website for you to learn more about me.



## About Me 

I am currently a sophmore at James Madison University. I am studying ISAT and plan on concentrating on Environment and Production Systems. Some of my favorite hobbies include working out, fishing, and hunting. I am from Midlothian, VA, which is around 30 minutes outside of Richmond, VA. I am looking forward to this semester, and I am excited to learn more about coding!

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Gavincj13/gavincj13.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
