## About Me 

I am currently a sophmore at James Madison University. I am studying ISAT and plan on concentrating on Environment and Production Systems. Some of my favorite hobbies include working out, fishing, and hunting. I am from Midlothian, VA, which is around 30 minutes outside of Richmond, VA. I am looking forward to this semester, and I am excited to learn more about coding!
